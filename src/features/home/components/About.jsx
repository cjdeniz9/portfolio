        Hello there! I'm Christian Deniz, a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona with a
        Computer Information Systems major driven to make waves in the world of
        web development as an aspiring Front-end Developer. My journey into the
        realm of coding began with a fascination for crafting designs into code,
        and I've since honed my skills in React to bring dynamic and responsive
        web experiences to life. I thrive in collaborative environments where I
        can contribute my creativity and problem-solving skills to create
        innovative solutions. Currently seeking opportunities to grow and learn
        in a supportive team environment.
